# Running a Java Fat JAR

A Fat JAR is a Java Archive (JAR) file that contains all the necessary dependencies to run a Java application. To run a Fat JAR, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

- You must have Java (JRE or JDK) installed on your computer.

## Steps

1. **Download the Fat JAR**: If you haven't already, download the Fat JAR file to your computer.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: Use your operating system's terminal or command prompt to run the Java application.

3. **Navigate to the Directory Containing the Fat JAR**: Use the `cd` command to change the current directory to the one where your Fat JAR is located.

   ```shell
   cd /path/to/your/fat-jar-directory
   run : java -jar fat.jar
